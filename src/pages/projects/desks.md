Yes, I have other hobby projects besides programing. I built my two desks a couple months after moving to San Diego. The table tops are just Ikea table tops, but the rest of the frames are made from 2x4's. I built them mostly using hand tools. The only power tool I used to build these were a drill to make the joints between the legs and aprons more stable. I used a chisel and hack saw to cut half lap joints between the legs and aprons and glued them using wood glue.

I then sanded the frames and finished them with shellac. The color came out pretty nice.

The frame isn't entirely square or level, but for a first woodworking project, I'd say its pretty good! The only downsie is that they look like science lab benches...

But they're much better than the cardboard box I was using while building these!
