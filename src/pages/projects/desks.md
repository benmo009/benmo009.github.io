Yes, I have other hobby projects besides programing. I built my two desks a couple months after moving to San Diego. The table tops are just Ikea table tops, but the rest of the frames are made from 2x4's. I built them mostly using hand tools. The only power tool I used to build these were a drill to make the joints between the legs and aprons more stable. I used a chisel and hack saw to cut half lap joints between the legs and aprons and glued them using wood glue.

<div class="flex flex-wrap justify-center p-3 space-x-2">
    <img class="w-80 flex-initial" src="/assets/desks/frame_2.jpg"/>
    <img class="w-80 flex-initial" src="/assets/desks/frame_3.jpg"/>
</div>


I then sanded the frames and finished them with shellac. The color came out pretty nice.

</div>


The frames aren't entirely square or level, but for a first woodworking project, I'd say they're pretty good! The only downside is that they look like science lab benches...

</div>

But they're much better than the cardboard box I was using while building these!
