The first PCB I ever designed and had manufactured. I originally attempted to make it with perfboard, but quickly got tired of soldering (maybe because I only had a cheap \$20 soldering iron that wouldn't get hot enough). It had been a long time goal of mine to learn PCB design, so I figured why not start now?
